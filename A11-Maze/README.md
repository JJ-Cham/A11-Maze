## Reflection

Do you have any remaining questions about this assignment?
I understand the recursive solver well, but I’m still unsure about some details of Dijkstra’s algorithm, especially whether my implementation is the most efficient or if there are alternative data structures that would make it clearer.

In phase four, what method did you choose to store the extra data?  Why did you make this choice?
I used 2D arrays (dist and prev) to store extra data. This felt natural since the maze is already a grid, and it kept indexing simple. Even though it works, I’m not fully confident it’s the best approach compared to using hash maps or other structures.
Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
This assignment helped me see how recursion can implicitly track paths, and how graph algorithms apply to mazes. I felt comfortable with the recursive exploration, but Dijkstra’s algorithm challenged me more. Overall, I learned a lot about connecting theory (graphs, recursion) to practical problem-solving.
